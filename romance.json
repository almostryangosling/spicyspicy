If you like gothic romances with vampires, I have something for you: Byzantium Movie (from r/fantasyromance)\n\n**Score:** 90\n**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n4nz7v\n**Body:** A new Dracula movie was recently released, and i was researching the protagonist. (If you liked Dracula 2025, it's the same actor). I discovered he'd already filmed a vampire movie. AND LET ME TELL YOU. What caught my attention was that in this film the protagonist is a female vampire; they're almost always male vampires. So i hoped with all my heart to see a romance between a female vampire and a male human. The protagonist is a melancholic, solitary, and reserved vampire woman. The plot revolves around two vampire women who spend their time running and moving to survive. The romance is strangely calm at first; she doesn't seem interested, but in reality, she's a person who becomes very detached due to the constant need to move. The guy is simply gorgeous. The actress is also very beautiful, it feels like a Role reversal relationship, which pleasantly surprised me. If you're someone who likes very beautiful and feminine men, you should watch the movie. He's very demonstrative, unlike her. I'll just say that in one scene HE ASKS HER TO BITE HIM and in another scene THERE IS A VAMPIRIC KISS WITH BLOOD. KISS.WITH.BLOOD. If you know of any other similar movies or books, please recommend them. \n\n\n\n### Top 7 comments and their replies (up to depth 25)\n\n1. * Please be mindful of our sub rules ([short version](https://www.reddit.com/mod/fantasyromance/wiki/index/rules) or [detailed version](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyromance/wiki/index/rules/detailed_rules/)) and treat others with kindness. \n* You can use the [\u2728Magic Search Button\u2728](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Ffantasyromance&amp;sca_esv=62677d62e4a19e1b&amp;ei=NcVuaLK6Oo68wPAPqJrSiA0&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyqMrFw7COAxUOHhAIHSiNFNEQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Ffantasyromance&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiIHNpdGU6cmVkZGl0LmNvbS9yL2ZhbnRhc3lyb21hbmNlSNI8UKYDWME6cAF4AJABAJgBhwKgAacRqgEGMjQuMS4xuAEDyAEA-AEBmAIAoAIAmAMAiAYBkgcAoAeSCbIHALgHAMIHAMgHAA&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp) to search for previous posts.\n* Call upon RomanceBot by wrapping a book title and author in curly brackets {} to get a summary from [Romance.io ](www.romance.io)\n* If you get an especially helpful comment, you can pin it by clicking on the comment and selecting \"spotlight.\"\n\nThanks, and happy reading!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I recently saw Dracula (2025) and thought it was amazing. It\u2019s so wacky and doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, but what shined through most was this actor\u2019s performance. I get that it got some flak because the contrast btw wacky Willy wonka vibes and very serious romantasy vibes was too jarring, but his acting was truly on par with Gary Oldman\u2019s. Highly recommend Dracula 2025 for his performance alone (it screams gothic romantasy longing)\n  - I haven't seen that movie yet (Dr\u00e1cula), but from what I've seen he looks like a pretty dramatic and pompous vampire, so i understand they think he is like Willy Wonka. In this film, he's more ordinary and very open about showing interest in the protagonist. There are scenes where he looks very adorable because he has dreamy eyes.\n3. That sounds amazing, thanks! Saoirse Ronan *and* Gemma Arterton as vampires - I can see why you call them beautiful :)\n\nAlso, I did an image search on Caleb Landry Jones, and it's wild how he can look like several different people.\n  - I was surprised too, from what I've seen he has a great acting range. The film has a gothic aesthetic and rhythm, even though it is not a period film.\n4. Thank you!!\n5. It\u2019s one of my favourite movies. Fantasy mixed with noir.\n  - Me too!!!! It\u2019s such a dark horse, under the radar amazing film. Incredible director and incredible cast, so I honestly don\u2019t see how it doesn\u2019t get more attention.\n6.

A weird crazy kind of love story line I guess.\n\nSo can anyone recommend any thriller, romance or just romance or just thriller idk but similar to the protagonist in SD but they actually fall in love\n\nAm I making sense?\n\n### Top 12 comments and their replies (up to depth 25)\n\n1.

If you are seeing this and don\u2019t know much about Woody Allen, do a little reading before declaring yourself a fan. Please.\n  - I feel like Woody Allen sucking as a person is very evident in the script of this film. Every line of dialogue to, about or by a woman just reeks of a lack of respect for them as people. Unfortunately, I fucking love Midnight In Paris.\n    - [removed]\n      - There are still actresses defending Weinstein, I don't know why you think any of these remarks say anything about Woody Allen\n        - [removed]\n  - [removed]\n    - Well he s*xually assaulted a minor so I feel like that\u2019s reason enough\n    - What all have you read? The part where he sexually molested his adoptive daughter? The part where he started a sexual relationship and married his ex-gf's daughter?\n2. If you liked this, you'll love midnight in paris\n  - One of my favourite films. Fantastic soundtrack and absolutely beautiful locations.\n  - Thank you, i\u2019ll watch it\n3.

Everyone is so respectful, and the comments are such high quality. I can't believe how insightful everyone here is, plus it's just fun. We must have some awesome mods putting in a lot of work!\n2. We're small but mighty. I'm shocked there's 4k people in here now, I found the sub before it had 50 members lol\n  - Same here. Proud of our little sub \u2764\ufe0f\n  - im not sure when i found this place, i remember lurking for a while before joining and commenting\ud83e\udd14 maybe early 2024\n    - I was busy getting downvoted on the main sub then the user who created this one dropped a comment linking it. I've never looked back. But that was, I think, almost 2yrs ago to the month\n3. Ahhh! I love it!! \ud83d\ude0d\n4. The fact that I\u2019m in 3 of the subreddits shown \ud83d\ude02 also yay!!!!\n  - which 3?\n5.

Idk then\n      - I think it is currently only available for rent on Apple TV and prime as opposed to being viewable with your subscription. It is worth renting in my opinion :)\n        - Ok will do thaf thanks for the reply\n          - You\u2019re welcome! Enjoy!\n  - Two movies together.

Love Scout\n3. **Alchemy of Souls** \\-- The leads butt heads in S1 due to both having strong personalities. While the FL in S2 is a bit timid, she is still very direct in her romantic pursuit. \n\n**Mr. Queen** \\-- The leads have a hilarious dynamic because they are operating from two very different sets of expectations. \n\n**Chicago Typewriter** \\-- The initial dynamic is the ML being rude and the FL refusing to put up with it\n  - Loved naksu &amp; janguk in both seasons but especially 1!\n    - I hate how they made her the damsel-in-distress in p2.\n4. My Roommate is a Gumiho\n5. You might enjoy Business Proposal!  It\u2019s very silly and tropey and isn\u2019t afraid to poke fun at itself, and the meeting of the two leads is as far from shy as you can get \ud83d\ude05\n  - I've seen it. Best pilot episode to possibly any series\ud83e\udd23\n    - A little off piste then but have you seen Healer?  Two confident characters there, although it\u2019s somewhat murkied by various necessary aliases etc due to the plot\n6. I might be biased since I love both So Ji Sub an Shin Mina bit I really love Oh my Venus.\n7. Just finished King the Land and loved the leads, super healthy relationship, confident and badass duo.\u00a0\n\n## 15. What romance movies / tv shows did you watch this week?

I watched the last season of Upload. A meh 3 stars.\ud83d\ude22\n  - I didn't even know it came out a few days ago. The lack of marketing is surprising.\n    - &gt; The lack of marketing is surprising.\n\nNot so much. a 4 episode season that they took 2 years to release means they just didn't want to have an unfinished show (which would cost future views) in their library rather than indicating commitment IMHO.\n      - It's only 4 episodes?? What!? If it was a good 4 episodes it would have been great.\u00a0\n  - Disappointing\n    - Yep. I loved the first season and the second season from episode 4 onwards... SIGH (literally\ud83e\udd23).\n2. **Chungking Express** (1994) (*rewatch*)\n\n**Rating :-**  Solid 8/10\n\n*A WKW classic , i loved how WKW portrays 90s hongkong, and how he showcased loneliness in romantic way. And Christopher Doyle is just amazing . Those low frame rate shot were just aesthetic. Now it's just impossible to even think about ' California Dreamin ' without imagining faye wong dancing to it .*\n3. Firelight (1997) : 10/10\n\nI didn't expect such a high-quality film. Everything is almost perfect for me. Probably Sophie Marceau's best performance. The emotion is very present. The story and the music complete the picture. A big thank you.\n  - Love this film!\n4. *Untamed Heart* starring Christian Slater &amp; Marisa Tomei. \n\nSweet; simple tearjerker romance. \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen it since it was in theaters. I was very surprised to see Stanford Blatch in it. It holds up, too. Very 90s.\n5. Finally finished \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d I would give 7/10. It was cute, but sometimes I wasn\u2019t sure that Channing &amp; ScarJo worked as a couple. Still an easy watch.\n\n---\n\n"}

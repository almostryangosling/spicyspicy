It\u2019s usually an audiobook, podcast, documentary, or a TV series I\u2019ve watched a million times. But I\u2019ve been in the mood for a movie lately. I have most streaming services as well as several British-genre ones.\n\nMy wish list:\n\n\u2014Oddly, I like comedies.

The best things to fall asleep to are things you\u2019ve seen many many times. It keeps your subconscious comfy cause there are no surprises and you can lull.\n  - Very true. Once, during a stressful period before finals I was watching Sleepless Seattle, Mamma Mia, and When Harry Met Sally on repeat. It would help me calm down and focus if I had it on in the background.\n  - Great way to explain it!

You can find lots of those videos (no ads) on YT.\n6. Young Frankenstein\n\nGalaxy Quest has been my favorite comfort movie for years. \n\nHeartbreakers (2001) with Sigourney Weaver, Gene Hackman and Jennifer Love Hewitt is a fun anti-romcom.\n7.

Guy escapes from Prison only to be killed by Tom Cruise during an alien invasion.\n  - Guy survives Vietnam only to find out the government tested a combat drug on him, only to find out he actually died, only to join the Film Actor\u2019s Guild and get burned to death by Team America at Kim Jong-il\u2019s palace.\n3. The son was an asshat.\n  - Yes but also felt like a perfect portrayal of a teenaged son who is pissed at his legitimately dickish/disinterested father.\n4. One dies or they all die\n5. Justified? Yes.\n\nIt wasn't handled as a throw-away event either. Tom Cruise's acting in this movie is very good. Despite being typically cast as an action hero, here he plays a scared father pushed to the edge in many scenes. He didn't want to kill that guy, and it was hard for him to take.\n\nEdit: typos\n  - I worked in a movie theater when this was out, and people were skeptical of seeing it. \"I'm not really in the mood for an action movie\". I made sure they were aware it was sci-fi horror and that actually got quite a few people interested. A lot of people thought it was another Independence Day.\n6.

Have you ever walked out of a movie in the theatre?\n\n**Score:** 380\n**Body:** Went to see \u201cEpic Movie\u201d back in the day when it was in theatres.

I'm an in-it-to-win-it kind of guy. Even if the movie sucks, I'm not leaving. I'm still there for the popcorn and perhaps a little nap. I've carved out a couple hours for my day at this point and I'm not rescheduling.\n  - I was like this with video games as a kid. I paid good pocket money to rent my video game and I'm damn well playing it, even if it's terrible\u00a0\n2. Almost walked out once. I got tickets to see Star Wars Ep. III when it came back to theaters this year. I had the entire theater to myself, which I thought was odd, until the movie started playing in Spanish.\n\nFortunately, I stuck it out, with the half pint of whiskey I had smuggled in, and had one of the funniest times I have ever had at the movies.\n\n\"Eres mi hermano, Anakin!\"\n  - That\u2019s hilarious. Was it at least subbed in English? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n    - Nope, I'd seen it so many times before that I really didn't need them, and the Spanish voice actors were superb. \n\nAll in all, 10/10.\n3. I feel like if you go to Epic Movie, you must know what it is before ya walk in.\n  - I agree ... it has the word \"movie\" in the title.. surely this was an indicator that it was going to suck a set of hairy, King Kong sized nuts. Any movie with movie in the title is an automatic no for me for this exact reason.\n4. No, I\u2019m a stay and suffer through every minute kinda girl.\n5. I loved the Max Payne games, and my friend had never played them. We went to see the movie opening weekend. I hated it because it wasn\u2019t faithful to the games, but stuck it out because I thought he was enjoying it on its own merits. He hated it because it was hot garbage, but stuck it out because he thought it must be more enjoyable to a fan of the game. We both wanted to walk out, but stayed for the other person.\n\nThat\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve gotten.\n6. I walk out of a lot of movies.\n\n  \nI try not to, but I always end up having to pee at some point.\n\n## 5.

Is Hollywood really dying?\n\n**Score:** 169\n**Body:** I keep seeing people say \u201chollywood is dying\u201d and honestly I\u2019m starting to wonder if it\u2019s true. It feels like every other week there\u2019s news about box office bombs like endless reboots and sequels nobody asked for and audiences just not showing up like they used to. Streaming has completely changed how people watch movies and a lot of the hype that used to surround big releases just isn\u2019t there anymore. On top of that so many people complain that hollywood has lost its originality. It\u2019s either superhero movies, remakes or giant CGI spectacles that all feel the same. Meanwhile a lot of smaller and more creative projects are either getting buried or ending up on streaming platforms where they don\u2019t get the same attention.\n\nBut then again hollywood has been \u201cdying\u201d in people\u2019s eyes for decades and it always seems to adapt somehow. So is this just another phase or are we actually watching the decline of the hollywood machine as we knew it?\n\n### Top 7 comments and their replies (up to depth 10)\n\n1. I work(ed) in the entertainment industry in LA. Yes, it is. Most of us are out of work when we were working very steadily before. A lot of production is moving out of LA. Staff on tv shows is being cut to an unsustainably small amount of people. Anyone who doesn't live in LA and doesn't have any ties to the entertainment industry doesn't know what they're talking about. Unless you experience it or hear countless tearful stories from your friends, you wouldn't really know what's going on right now.\n2. Depends what 'dying' is defined as?\n\nIn general Hollywood still has a lot of power but it's on the wane, the rise of Asia and tax incentives outside of the USA has made a real impact. We see Asia being a real powerhouse with Manga/Anime from Japan, TV/Films from Korea and China starting to see a real rise in the domestic market for China made films/media.\n\nYou also see a massive cut in work in America, Netflix is pushing more money over to Asia for new productions instead of America. The audience want Asian media &amp; it costs less to make, it's win win for the money men.\n\nStill at the same time Hollywood has a lot of power/money, it's going to be a long time before it's lost relevance.\n  - If you go look at the stuff on Netflix right now, SO MUCH of it is done overseas.\n\nI mean, it used to be 5% of Netflix.  It's got to be closer to 25% now.\n    - Netflix streaming  used to be 95% NBC/FX/AMC content + movie sequels. Then the networks realized they could sell their own catalogs and the remaining cheap content licenses are foreign.\n    - Yeah, and their most successful show is Squid Game from South Korea.\n  - A consequence of streaming further operating as \"global\" companies. Hollywood has long tried to appeal to international markets, but the streaming model &amp; companies that own them have essentially delivered it to its logical end: the U.S is simply a smaller audience than many other parts of the world. The companies here are making more shows for other countries and less for our local audience.\n3. Hollywood isn\u2019t dying. It\u2019s bleeding out under corporate control and cultural change.\n\nStudios have been absorbed by corporations that care only about quarterly returns. That shift siphoned off the artistry. Not gone entirely, but the default mode is product, not film. The aim is to capture dollars, not move people.\n\nCulture shifted too. Theaters used to be the place. Now they\u2019re a luxury. A ticket, popcorn, and soda can run fifty bucks. That\u2019s not inflation alone. Those numbers are baked in by deals between studios and theater chains. On top of that, people are trained to expect the pause button and home setups that look sharper than what a lot of theaters can deliver.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the theater experience itself. Phones glowing, people talking, constant distractions. Immersion dies in that setting.\n\nAs for superhero movies, they\u2019re not the core issue. Every era had its wave: musicals, westerns, gangster flicks. The real problem is volume without care. When the market floods itself with interchangeable product, audiences check out.\n\nSo no, Hollywood isn\u2019t dying. It\u2019s just stuck in a loop of self-cannibalization, feeding shareholders while training audiences to stay home. The machine still hums , but its pulse is weak.\n4. From an Australian who mostly watches foreign films\u2026. Hollywood seems to make two types of films these days: Superhero films / remakes of older IP like Jurassic World, and auteur Oscar bait biopic stuff. It\u2019s all so boring. I recently watched an independent film called The Mastermind that was deeply flawed and awfully paced and was written, directed and edited by the Auteur Kelly Reinhardt. Seems like you need to reach a certain level before you\u2019re considered a \u201cgenius\u201d and then you get Carter Blanche to make whatever you like. Obviously there are exceptions like A24 stuff, but these are not generating the kind of box office money that films like Kill Bill etc were generating 20 years ago. As much as an evil bastard Harvey Weinstein was, there\u2019s a massive void in Hollywood for the type of films Miramax would produce.\n5. I think great things are coming out all time. Post covid the pendulum has seemed to have swung back to the movie side from tv in terms of whats better. Now how much support these movies are getting is a bit of a debate. The big piece of information the public doesnt get is how well these movies do on vod. I suspect better than we think because comments get made. Robert Eggers said The Northman broke even a few months after that hit vod. Soderbergh said this year that Black Bag will eventually be okay. \n\nA24 did Sorry Baby and Eddington poorly this year. I loved both of them but their release dates were horrible. I dont know exactly what the right answer is but I think its better than the doom and gloom articles let on.\n6. It\u2019s not looking good. Ticket sales are at an all time low, which means theaters aren\u2019t making money at the concessions. And if theaters permanently, then Hollywood can\u2019t pay anybody working on their movies and sets. It\u2019s a dark future down the line.\n\n## 2. A revisitation of 3 Women\n\n**Score:** 16\n**Body:** Around 9 years ago, when I first started exploring cinema, I was immediately intrigued by surrealism, both by its propensity to be creative in different ways than just normal expressionism and for the unsettling atmosphere it can create. This came about because the first true \u201cart house\u201d film I ever saw was Eraserhead, it\u2019s very stylized depiction of reality being unlike anything I had ever seen before in any art form, forget cinema. This led me to exploring other surrealist works soon after, including Bu\u00f1uel, and later, this movie.\n\nPrior to seeing this, I had little knowledge of Altman. In fact, this may have been the first movie of his I ever saw, if only for the fact its similarities to Mulholland Drive and other female focused Lynch movies has been widely noted, which made me more curious to check it out than his more notable classics like Nashville or the Long Goodbye. At the time, I loved it for the way it depicted fusing perspectives and the aforementioned unsettling atmosphere. It made me interested in exploring the rest of Altman\u2019s work and he soon became one of my favorite directors ever. \n\nSince then, I have continually held this film in high regard, often claiming it as my favorite of his works, even without repeat viewings. This especially made me nervous to revisit it, as I was scared my naturally changed perspective from growing older would no longer get much out of a film that had resonated with someone who was basically a different person. But the thing about changing your perspective on life is that you can also come to appreciate something differently from when it first came to you. I\u2019m very glad to say this is what happened this time, as I loved this film just as much as before, but for new reasons.\n\nI think what stuck out to me this time, beyond the fused perspectives and characters of the film, was how it utilized wetness and dryness. Most of the film takes place in dry, arid areas, where life seems to be about snuffed out and people are going through the motions without knowing they\u2019re already halfway to the grave. The most iconic image of the film, outside of the mirrors and doubling reflections, is that of Sissy Spacek gazing into an empty swimming pool that she then enters. It\u2019s easy to say that \u201csomething feels missing\u201d at this point, but I think a more accurate assessment would be that there is just a total lack of anything. It\u2019s deserted not just physically, but spiritually and emotionally. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a mistake that the few depictions of water in the film are associated with rejuvenation and resurrection. The old folks home shows this early on, as they give the clients time to soak in water to feel better in the communal pool. When Spacek\u2019s character attempts suicide in their apartment\u2019s pool, she is reborn a few scenes after with a new personality. Water also ties the women together throughout the film, as Altman often overlays fish tanks on their faces to indicate their connection. \n\nWhat I\u2019m driving at here is that I think Altman is saying that, if Nashville was America\u2019s march into death while we all act like everything is fine, 3 Women is showing that America is already dead. No one seems to have much to live for except for getting up and going to work, which is likely why Spacek latches on so much to Duvall. She\u2019s trying to assimilate to her personality because she lacks one, because the society she lives in lacks one. It\u2019s a depressing notion but isn\u2019t this sort of relationship not a little reminiscent of parasocial relationships in real life? Or really, any kind of obsessive relationship? I hesitate to say codependency, but if you pay attention, the signs of that are there too, especially after the suicide attempt, when Duvall gets so concerned about Spacek that it nearly becomes her entire life. It\u2019s hard not to sympathize with Spacek for this reason; she\u2019s basically been given nothing in life and been expected to make herself something with it.\n\nI still do wonder about the role of the third woman and what her significance is. Given that she doesn\u2019t play too much of a role in these story it\u2019s hard to say what exactly she is supposed to represent, but I think there are two ways you can look at it that aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. 1. She\u2019s sort of a matronly figure that spiritually rebirths both Spacek and Duvall and 2. She\u2019s a goddess of some sort who came to the mortal realm and has no specific meaning other than to create a sense of magic in the film. I think both readings are equally valid, and as I said not mutually exclusive. \n\nSuffice to say, this has remained one of my favorite Altman films, and I highly recommend you see it if you haven\u2019t already. And if you have seen it, watch it again because it rules.\n\n### Top 3 comments and their replies (up to depth 10)\n\n1. What struck me revisiting *3 Women* is how much it feels like Altman made his own version of *Persona*, but filtered through the desolation of small-town America. The shifting identities aren\u2019t just surreal flourishes - they feel like a survival strategy in an environment where individuality has already dried up. The \u201cthird woman\u201d then reads less as a literal character and more as the ghost of a role model, the absence that shapes the other two.\n  - Couldn\u2019t agree more.\n2. I love 3 Women. To this day, it feels like the closest a film has come to representing what dreams are actually like (fitting because it literally came to Altman in a dream). There's something so eerie and illogical about it all, but it still captures this full authenticity and truthfulness. There are so many brilliant lenses to view it through.\n\nI may have to disagree with your take on Nashville, though. I've always been of the opinion that the ending of that movie is not wholly pessimistic. Yes, there's obviously a lot of awful things going on, but I never had the feeling that Nashville was really a full-on tragedy. The big death at the end of the film was definitely prophetic about our current celebrity and gun culture, but I also think by having everyone join in and sing, Altman is portraying American Resiliency as much as he's portraying our ignorance and distractibility. To me, painting it as \"America's March to death\" ignores a lot of the positive traits of humanity that are on display in those closing minutes.\n  - That\u2019s a fair take on Nashville, even if I do read it as more negative. He was a humanist after all, and Nashville is maybe the most humanist movie of them all (idk what could be more humanist, at least in America). I think the rest of the movie is better for showcasing the positive traits of humanity tbh\n    - I agree. I definitely think there are many cynical elements to the ending, I just think the \"star is born\" moment of Albuquerque finally getting the microphone and singing It Don't Worry Me can be viewed as the idea of something positive coming out of a tragedy. Similarly, I've always viewed Haven's heroic \"This isn't Dallas\" moment as a hint that the egotistical country star we've watched throughout the movie is actually more of a 'man of the people' than the faceless Hal Phillip Walker broadcasting nonsensical platitudes from a roving van.\n\nIt's my favorite film of all time so I have a lot of feelings on it. As you've said, Altman was a humanist and so I struggle to think he chose to end his magnum opus with something akin to \"look at all these easily mollified sheeple.\"\n3. Just say 3 Women for the first time last month, and it was really fascinating. Definitely feels like required viewing if you're at all a fan of Altman. While it undoubtably echoes Persona, it also reaches forward in influence to things like Mulholland Drive, making a pretty interesting continuum of influence.\n\nI'm looking forward to rewatching again at some point, because the plot and stylistic turns between the acts were pretty hard to process on a first viewing. I kind of wish we just had a whole movie with the hangout vibe of the first act! But still it's worth it to get to the psychological horror and dream states of the later acts.\n\n## 3. Caught Stealing\n\n**Score:** 8\n**Body:** (this started out as me just wanting to hear what people think of it and then it sort of turned into a review? Idk how many people have had a chance to see it yet. An extremely vague spoiler behind spoiler tags)\n\nSaw this last night and had a blast. One of my friends didn't like it so much and compared it to Tarantino; my other friends loved it and compared it to Guy Ritchie, while repeatedly exclaiming over how different this was for Aronofsky. I don't *quite* agree with any of these points, but I think they triangulate toward something I agree with. \n\nThis movie has a very 90s combination of action, crime caper humor and silliness*, and not just \"grit\" but actual harshness and grossness. In that latter part it's still very Aronofsky; I think everyone's just surprised that he's capable of having fun. As a couple of critics have pointed out, some of his consistent themes are addiction, obsession, and performance under pressure (successful or not), and all of those are right in the center of Caught Stealing. What's surprising for him is that the protagonist &gt;!actually escapes those burdens!&lt; by the end.\n\nBut the movie is also very intelligently constructed in how it uses those elements. It starts out relatively serious and sad while it's establishing characters and stakes, and gradually turns into more of an action cartoon/farce as it goes along. The way flashbacks play through the whole movie until the incident they show enters the present at the end really sums up the tonal progression, but I can't really describe what I mean by that without spoiling. I think this gradual tonal shift also helped with the element of freshness and surprise - some twists I saw coming, some I didn't, and it was easier to be surprised when the groundwork had been laid in a different tone than we were in by the time the twist came to fruition.\n\nThis all requires the lead actor to be able to carry a few different tones and moods while keeping the character consistent and helping the audience buy in with his reaction to the situations he's in through the whole series of shifts, and Austin Butler did that pretty seamlessly. (I'd say that as Hank gets less incredulous and confused about his situation and more determined to get through it and sure that he will, the movie gets less grounded, and that balance works.) The performances in general are good (special shout-out to Carol Kane), but he is really showing star power here - tbh that's probably also a big part of what had me feeling the 90s, this type of emotional and physical performance being balanced on presence/charisma. I hope mid-sized movies that allow him to shine like this keep coming.\n\nAll in all, a great time at the movies, definitely recommend.\n\n### Top 4 comments and their replies (up to depth 10)\n\n1. As a fan of Guy Ritchie's style of action-comedies, I was really hyped for this one after watching the trailer, but was really dissapointed after watching it. The plot felt dumb and uninspired and the juggling of serious and silly scenes never clicked and felt really jarring. To it's credit, it's a well shot movie and Idles made a great soundtrack. It had it's funny moments too, but after it ended I was more bored than entertained.\n2. Yeah I saw I last week and really enjoyed it. Are there flaws in the film? Probably, but I don\u2019t really care. It reminded me of After Hours by Scorsese, it had a great cast, Austin Butler is a bonafide movie star. Masterpiece? Obviously not. A well spent, fun two hours at the cinema? 100%. I\u2019d love more films to come out at this sort of level\n3. Pulling off this mixture of extreme violence and comedy is like walking a tightrope. Arguably the film falls off the tightrope with the death of a specific character. It plunges everything else into a darkness that can not be escaped.\n4. Saw it yesterday. It was really good and lots of fun, I thought of Coens and Safdies while watching it. I liked how cruel it was. I wonder if Aronofsky plans to adapt the 2 other books from the trilogy. I would certainly like to see that.\n\n## 4. Save The Green Planet or Bugonia first?\n\n**Score:** 6\n**Body:** Those of you who have seen both 2003\u2019s Save The Green Planet and the recent Bugonia, which one should I watch first? I believe Bugonia is a remake, don\u2019t know how accurate it stays to the original and I dont want to google as I\u2019m very weary of spoilers, as you might have noticed. I\u2019m a fan of weird Japanese cult films as well as Lanthimos, Stone and Plemmons! What should I do? \n\n### Top 4 comments and their replies (up to depth 10)\n\n1. Save The Green Planet is a Korean movie, not Japanese. \n\nAnd I usually watch remakes first, that way I don't have to think \"but that wasn't like that in the original?!\" and take it as is. Then I watch the original, which then becomes a separate experience.\n  - I do this with books if I haven't read them.  There's a better chance of me enjoying a movie, and then enjoying a book more.  \n\nI don't have a lot of situations where I enjoyed a book, and then wasn't bugged by the changes the movie made.\n    - I'm the same way with adaptations. Most of the times I'm annoyed by the changes, so I try to watch the adaptation first. Even the Lord of the Rings movies annoyed me for a while, though I learned to love them in time.\n2. I think it's always good to see the original before seeing the remake. I haven't watched Bugonia, but from the trailer, it looks different. Starting with Emma Stone's character, who in the original is a man. I don't remember if Jesse Plemons' character had an assistant in the original, it's been a while since I saw it and my memory is terrible.\n  - He has an assistant that he manipulates but it's a woman\n  - You think I should watch The Thing (1951) before watching the 1982 classic???\n\nMy point I disagree. In cases where a remake tells a story much better, I think it\u2019s fair to suggest watching the remake first so the twist is not ruined by a lame film. Idk anything about Bugonia though\n    - The 1951 Thing is not lame.\n    - Yes, why not? Before seeing \"Scarface\" from 1983, I saw the original from 1932, which was also by Howard Hawks. They are two different and very good films. \n\nI think that if you are going to watch a film knowing that it is a remake and you have the option of only watching the original beforehand, watch the original first. I don't believe that one film ruins the other. This week I'm going to watch Kurosawa's \"High and Low\" because I really want to see Spike Lee's remake, I'm going to take the opportunity to remove it from the watchlist.\n    - Yes the original is also a classic\n3. It doesn't really matter I guess because it will not change your views on either films big time. Also, it does not matter whatsoever how accurate the remake might be. What matter is the director's vision for his film, wether it's a remake or not. \n\nI'm definitely not a big fan of Lanthimos (I can say that I only moderately like Dogtooth), but I really like Save the Green Planet. So I will definitely watch Bugonia, just to see how this story translates in our actual world. This might be interesting.\n\n## 5. What's the worst Hollywood studio story you know?\n\n**Score:** 13\n**Body:** So I was doing some research in to music record labels and how they conduct business. \n\nBasically there was an artist back in the 2010's, I don't know if you guys know him, his name was Lupe Fiasco. Anyways, he was signed to Atlantic Records and dropped a track that they had nothing to do with but they wanted in on the action because was previously signed with them. Lupe said no. However, the record label then discovered his new song used a sample from a woman's song who lived in the Philippines. So the record executives flew to the Philippines, found the lady, paid her off for her rights, then contacted Lupe and basically told him he had to pay them now.\n\n  \nThis was some Italian mafia shit\n\nAny similar Hollywood stories?\n\n### Top 2 comments and their replies (up to depth 10)\n\n1. Screwing over someone on music rights? Man, that wouldn't even nudge the needle in Golden Age Hollywood.\n\nMost of the Wizard of Oz main cast was sickened, injured, or physically/psychologically tortured in some way, and that was just a single production!\n\nSome actors were subject to having their entire private lives managed by the studios (gay actors required to marry studio-picked \"beard\" wives to more convincingly stay in the closet, pregnant talent pressured into abortions, you name it).\n  - Yeah, \u201cworst\u201d is definitely not the word for this story when Harvey Weinstein exists\u2026that being said, in its own right it\u2019s interesting as hell, so no shade to OP! I\u2019d put it under \u201cimpressively petty\u201d more than anything.\n2.

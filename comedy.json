Neil Patrick Harris in Harold &amp; Kumar go to White Castle. Not just stole the movie but reignited his career in a huge way.\n  - Forget White Castle, let\u2019s go get some pussy!\n  - This might be the best answer\n5. Michael Cera, This is the End\n6.

I'm not sure it steals the whole movie but Johnny Depp in 21 Jump Street gets some of the biggest reactions.\n8. Channing Tatum in This is the End. The other cameos were very much featured in the marketing leading up to its release, but his cameo came out of nowhere. It was also hilarious.\n9. Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder, quite unlike any other performance I\u2019ve seen from him.\n  - He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Golden Globes. That\u2019s not a cameo, in my opinion.\n10. Anchorman 2. Pretty much everyone involved in the big Anchorman fight near the end of the film including: Jim Carrey, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Liam Neeson, Will Smith, Sacha Baron Cohen, John C Reilly, Vince Vaughn, Kanye West, Kirsten Dunst and Marion Cotillard.\n11.

Michael Keaton\u2019s character is perfect and just adds to the pot! I can never get over the scene with the hot dog vendor offering free hot dogs for life but no drinks. The crowd going from cheering to disappointment is just too good for me! Also the scene when they\u2019re wrestling at the wake and loud whispering always has me laughing. \n\nWhat\u2019s one of your favorite comedy movies? And what scenes are most memorable to you? \n\n### Top 17 comments and their replies (up to depth 25)\n\n1. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\n\nNot a single wasted scene or line of dialogue. Absolute comedic perfection.\n2. The Death of Stalin. Pure brilliance in every aspect. And so goddamn funny.\n3. Black Dynamite\n  - You threw that shit before comin' in the room!\n4. Tropic Thunder. A great, edgy comedy with a great cast that would never be made today.\n5. Superbad always\n6. When I'm with my peers, Fish Called Wanda\n\nSecretly, Dude Where's My Car\n7. Loved Bad Santa.  The scenes with John Ritter with Billy and Tony were great.  Also his scenes with Bernie Mac. Octavia Spencer also has a small role, before she hit it big.  I watch it every December, or any time its on and I am flipping channels.\n  - In Bad Santa when he asks the kid \u201cwere you dropped on your head?\u201d And the kid goes \u201cMY head?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo someone else\u2019s head\u2026goddammit are you fucking with me?!?\u201d is so funny\n8. The Other Guys is so good. \n\nMine would be Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, Macgruber, and Adams Family Values. \n\nIn Macgruber when he blows up the van with his entire team in it and goes \u201cFuuuuccccckkkkkkkk. Omg! Are you guys ok? Somebody call 911\u201d makes me die laughing just thinking about it. The way he says it and the fact that he blew the van up with an obnoxious amount of dynamite and asks if they\u2019re ok is ridiculous. \n\nOr in Addams Family Values when Amanda goes \u201cI\u2019ll be victim!\u201d And Wednesday mumbles \u201call your life\u201d is gold.\n9. I may have missed it but didn\u2019t see it listed.\n\nThe Nice Guys is absolutely hilarious!\n  - I scrolled and scrolled to find this. This is my answer, also. I cried laughing more than a few times.\n10. I think they still haven\u2019t made a movie funnier than Life of Brian\n11. To many times list, but the first one that popped into my head is Hotrod.   If you are a fan or in the mood for a 'dumb' comedy its a great choice.\n  - I love hotrod! The plot to save his step dad so he can fight him, win, and show he\u2019s a man is downright ridiculous and hilarious.\n12. One of my favorite comedies is \"Coming To America\" (the original, not the similarly-named sequel).\n\nMy favorite scene is any of the barbershop scenes.  The banter is totally outrageous and hilarious.\n13. Hot Fuzz.  \n\nSo many callbacks and jokes.  Great script.\n14. For me, Paul Thomas Anderson's **Inherent Vice** has climbed into the upper echelon.\n15. White Chicks. The dance scene, \"you wanna talk about mother\", the dressing room scene, and of course \"A Thousand Miles\" scene\n16. Dumb And Dumber\n\nSuperbad \n\nOld School\n\n## 6.

How can that be profitable for Frito-Lay?\n  - Jesse Plemons NEEDS to take more comedic roles.\n    - Jesse plemons is fucking amazing.\n2. Cabin in the Woods. I expected a typical predictable horror. Ended up being one of the most original films i have seen.\n  - The marketing campaign keeping a lot of the movie a secret was a great choice\n    - Nothing more annoying than watching a preview that tells you everything.\n\nAbigale is a great example.  I saw the preview, my wife did not.  She did not expect the things that happened at all.  So movie was ok for me and was awesome for her.  I try to avoid previews all together now.\n3. Wind River had me thinking about it for weeks.\n  - Why you flanking me? How did you not see it?\n    - I've re-watched that scene so many times. It perfectly captures that tense feeling as as conversation shifts into confrontation\n4. Palm Springs\n\nIt's Andy Samberg's and Christin Milioti's best work and it ain't even close. I've watched it like 5 times and thought \"Damn I wish this was 1h longer\" every time.\n\n  \nAlso didn't expect to like the Lego Movie but it was cute.\n5. Office Space. Had nothing to do and it was the only one playing at the time.\n6. Tucker &amp; Dale vs Evil\n\nYou\u2019re welcome\n7. Staying with Jason Bateman, This is Where I Leave You is a great movie. Had zero idea what it was about, just liked the cast.\n  - Jason Bateman is just fantastic. Have you seen \"Bad Words?\"\n8. Those guys who made Game Night also made Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves which I was happy with both\n9. Good Will Hunting. It was Xmas Day and we couldn't get into Jackie Brown.\u00a0\n10. Recently; The Naked Gun (2025)\n\nCould not believe how funny it was and creative. It really does feel like a peak Leslie film, and Liam is so funny in it. Great movie\n11. Guns Akimbo was a blast.\n12. Game Night is so wildly underrated/underseen. \n\nTag was another one from right around there that I had no expectations and left the movie crying. \n\nPuss in Boots Last Wish we took the kids to. I havent* ever seen the other ones. That movie gutted me.\n13. Game Night is so effing good. Rachel McAdams is so underappreciated as a comedic actress. Her timing is incredible.\u00a0\n\n## 7.

May be directed by jeethu madhavan or Girish A D.\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n  - Agree! Just commented on another reply with Jithu as the next option.\n6. Horror comedy might be fun. Something like Go Goa Gone in Hindi\n7. Sadly Priyadarshan only cares about Akshay Kumar\n8. Priyan seems to be out of touch with comedy, even that comedy scene in Oppam worked bcz of nostalgia.\n  - If not Priyan then I think only Jithu Madhavan can pull off\n9. I don't think he can. For almost all his career in Malayalam film industry, he has stuck to a certain set of actors. Unfortunately almost all of them is no longer with us, so their is no point in expecting the priyadarshan magic of old.\n10. I dont think priyadarshan would be comfortable with the  type of comedy these 4 present. These people are gonna struggle with his vision.\n11. Basil could direct it, instead of priydarshan\n12. Yes!!!! Priyadarshan is master of comedy movies!\n13. Maybe without a romance track, like In Hari har nagar.\n\n## 8.

Robocop\n  - This would be the obvious answer and not surprising given it's the same director. But i agree. From a straight \"holy shit this is fun\" perspective Robocop &gt; Total Recall. Though Total Recall adds a very solid sci-fi element along with the \"was any of this real\" element.\n11.

I only saw it once. He made so many funny action movies it\u2019s hard to remember. I know one of my favorites will always be Wheels on Meals. A quirky truck, Jackie Chan skateboarding, a beautiful woman, the villains are more skilled than the leads, a great car chase\u2026\n7. Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins\n8.

True Lies.\u00a0\n\n\nThat movie really is perfect on the action-comedy front.\u00a0\n\n\nRIP Bill Paxton.\u00a0\n2. Who is your daddy, and what does he do??\n3. Jingle all The Way for me followed by Last Action Hero.\n  - Seconding \u201cJingle All The Way\u201d\n    - PUT THAT COOKIE DOWN. NOW!\n4. same - my daughter and I say \"it's not a tumor\" a lot\n\nWe come up with different versions of it.  In marvel comics the Submariner has an enemy named Attuma - so we will say \"It's not Attuma\" - any place we can fit \"It's not a....\" in we try\n5. I always have fun watching Jingle All The Way, though I understand why some people don't like that Arnie movie :-)\n6. Without a doubt, my favorite was Last Action Hero. It's a spoof of many action movies and is wonderfully tongue-in-cheek.\n7. Jingle All the Way.  Watch it every Christmas season\n8. Kindergarten Cop.\n  - \u201cdey\u2019re horrible !\u201d\n9. Twins.\n10. Kindergarten Cop is probably #1, followed by Twins. Watched them again after a long time recently, still awesome and fun\n11. Kindergarten Cop by MILES!\n12. Last Action Hero my fave\n13. Last action hero\n\nWay ahead of its time. Perfect satire of 80s action and a banger of a soundtrack\n14. I have time a hard re-watch lately and I'm going with Last Action Hero or Kindergarten Cop\n15. Junior\n16. Kindergarten Cop\n\n## 13. Darren Aronofsky's 'Caught Stealing' Review Thread (from r/movies)\n\n**Score:** 1378\n**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1n1l5m7/darren_aronofskys_caught_stealing_review_thread/\n**Body:** [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/caught_stealing): 84% (from 67 reviews) with 6.70 average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/caught-stealing/): 69/100 (19 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; Despite all the bloody violence, there is a buoyant feel to the film. Matthew Libatique, Aronofsky\u2019s constant and brilliant cinematographer, makes the city glittery bright outside and the look is vibrant even in the dingy bar. Caught Stealing is an anomaly, a dark soap bubble of an entertainment. And that weirdness makes this unlikely film sparkle.\n\n-[Caryn James, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/caught-stealing-review-austin-butler-darren-aronofsky-1236353041/)\n\n&gt; Mostly, the tension between the film\u2019s increasingly dark story and its love of rudimentary gags \u2014 wouldn\u2019t it be so funny if this guy who mostly subsists on booze physically couldn\u2019t drink anymore? \u2014 doesn\u2019t abate until the film\u2019s final act. That\u2019s when things click into place, when the big swings come together, and \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d nearly finds its way to (insert your favorite positive baseball metaphor here). A wild card? Not wild enough, really.\n\n-[Kate Erbland, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/caught-stealing-review-darren-aronofsky-austin-butler-1235147500/): C+\n\n&gt; \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d might feel like a break from the \u201cPi\u201d director\u2019s intensely subjective character portraits, which range from \u201cThe Wrestler\u201d to \u201cThe Whale,\u201d but in fact, Aronofsky brings us as close to Hank as he has to any of his other characters. For Butler, it\u2019s not as flashy a role as the ones he played in \u201cElvis\u201d or \u201cDune,\u201d and yet, seeing the actor stripped down to his heather gray undies, his stardom is all but undeniable.\n\n-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/caught-stealing-review-austin-butler-1236496926/)\n\n&gt; At one stage, Hank hits a few balls and instantly a crowd of people gather round, awed \u2013 and an old-timer tells him he has \u201cone hell of a swing\u201d. The film has it too.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/27/caught-stealing-review-darren-aronofsky-mother-the-whale-baseball): 4/5\n\n&gt; Some part of Aronofsky may want to evoke the darkly funny mishaps of a vintage crime comedy, but something else keeps coaxing him halfway down dark alleyways, before the movie scrambles back into more comic-adjacent urgency. It\u2019s that run-and-stop-short rhythm that makes Caught Stealing feel more like a fraught, imperfect recovery than a Requiem-style spiral into hell, and an unusually balanced New York portrait. The city of Aronofsky\u2019s early career is neither a paradise lost to gentrification nor a metropolis of the damned. It\u2019s just a bustling microcosm of a pitiless world with plenty of places to hide.\n\n-[Jesse Hassenger, The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/caught-stealing-review): B\n\n&gt; For as much good as there is in \"Caught Stealing,\" there's never that moment where it somehow rises from good to great \u2014 but hey, that's okay. It's just good and stays good until the credits roll, which is more than enough. Not every new movie needs to be an event. Sometimes, you just want to watch a handsome guy try to get out of trouble while taking care of an ornery, fluffy cat. We could use more modern movies like \"Caught Stealing.\" \n\n-[Ryan Scott, /Film](https://www.slashfilm.com/1944676/caught-stealing-austin-butler-movie-review/): 7.5/10\n\n&gt; The result is a movie that\u2019s very fun, but weirdly unambitious for Aronofsky. If any up-and-coming director made this movie, it\u2019d be seen as a promising breakthrough. For the guy known for Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan, Mother! and The Whale, it feels like he\u2019s slumming a bit. In a way, though, it\u2019s refreshing to see an Aronofsky movie that, for once, isn\u2019t bursting with more ideas than it can reasonably contain. It would still be nice in this instance to have a thematic through-line that wasn\u2019t just based in nostalgia for a bygone New York. It\u2019s doubtful Caught Stealing will make the same impression its director\u2019s other films have. Fortunately, though, its rewatchability factor is just as high.\n\n-[Abby Olcese, Paste](https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/caught-stealing/caught-stealing-review-darren-aronofsky-austin-butler-matt-smith-crime-plot): 7.5/10\n\n&gt; As much as the film is Aronofsky\u2019s least characteristic to date, with its Guy Ritchie-esque rogues gallery of crooks and killers and Coen-esque bursts of wry violence, it\u2019s Butler\u2019s performance that makes it feel of a piece with the director\u2019s other work. There are few filmmakers more interested in putting their characters in a vice grip, so as to bring them someplace where their physical traumas become a way for them to know themselves beyond the limits of the body.\n\n-[Rocco T. Thompson, Slant](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/caught-stealing-review-austin-butler-darren-aronofsky/): 2.5/4\n\n&gt; It\u2019s thin material for such an impressive cast to be working with, and even Butler, who\u2019s made all the right choices post-Elvis when it comes to compelling and varied work, can\u2019t really imagine Hank beyond the mould of tender-hearted victim. He takes all the beatings \u2013 and there are a lot of them, which is where Aronofsky\u2019s taste for the brutal slips in \u2013 with a noble tear in his eye, haunted as he is by a traumatic accident in his youth that put an end to his baseball career.\n\n-[Clarisse Loughrey, The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/caught-stealing-review-austin-butler-b2814868.html): 2/5\n\n&gt; For the most part, Caught Stealing is a riotous, rollicking ride studded with New York\u2019s concrete grit \u2014 but its sharper edges prove more difficult to endure.\n\n-[Ben Travis, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/caught-stealing/): 3/5\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nHank Thompson was a high-school baseball phenom who can't play anymore, but everything else is going okay.

I caught an early screening of this over the weekend and really enjoyed it. I feel like it's darker than the trailers imply, in a good way. Worth seeing in theaters for sure.\n  - 100%. We went to a preview too and my wife was shocked at how dark it was relative to the trailer. I\u2019d read the book and expect dark from Aronofsky - so for me it was less dark than I expected.\n  - Considering it's setting in 1998 NYC, I hope it really captures the \"dirty\" vibe of action/thrillers set in the city around that time period (especially those that make the city itself feel like a character)\n    - Oh it definitely does this, in spades. You won't be disappointed about that aspect at all.\n2. Saw a sneak preview and had a very fun time\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cmore serious\u201d version of Snatch/Bullet Train/Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels where a bunch of shady characters are involved in a mix-up.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s honestly the \u201cfunnest\u201d film that Darren\u2019s made if you ask me. Seems like everyone was having a good time with this.\u00a0\n  - No way it\u2019s any funner than requiem\n  - I liked it, but I also felt like Aronofsky doesn\u2019t have a sense of humor. Because the film was way quirkier and funnier than he wanted to go. It was at its best when it was goofy. But you could feel Aronofsky\u2019s seriousness trying to fight through the screwball humor.\n3. The book was recommended to me on this sub when the first images were released and it was a really fun ride. It looks like they only changed some small bits for film, otherwise it\u2019s all here. I\u2019m excited to see it this weekend.\n  - Ya the reviews seem to mention that it\u2019s dark with sudden funny gags and that is exactly how the book reads. In the second book &gt;!in a very tense chase Hank gets clotheslined by a literal clothesline and it is very funny but the chase still had a very gristly end that kept the tone bleak!&lt;\n4. It was a fun movie. Wild, frenetic, and darkly funny at times. I really loved most of the performances too. Not Aronofsky\u2019s very best but well worth the price of the ticket.\u00a0\n5. This is the most not Aronofsky movie ever and I'm so ready for it. It looks incredible.\n\n\n30 years making movies and he's still has something new to show, what a director.\n  - I haven't seen it yet, but it feels like Aronofsky tried to make an Edgar Wright-type of film.\n\nEdit: I'll just mention Guy Ritchie here too, both because I agree and like 4 replies have already pointed it out.\n    - I did, and it\u2019s kind of like that, but it\u2019s more of \u201cSnatch\u201d where a bunch of people are involved and searching for an item.\n\nIt\u2019s a really fun time, and definitely the most un-Aronofsky film I\u2019ve seen from him\u00a0\n6. Darren Aronofsky better give that review thread back. Stealing it isn't cool.\n7. I saw it. Solid but not as good as the movies it is emulating.\n\nOne key difference is Caught Stealing is not an ensemble. Having the protagonist in every scene makes it harder to have the same pace and gag opportunities.\n\nOn the plus side, Butler has to carry the movie for this reason and rises to the occasion. Aronofsky, as always, is great at getting performances out of people.\n8. I really liked it. Felt like a weaker Coen Brother\u2019s esque picture (which is still great). Was reminiscent a touch of After Hours by Scorsese in that it has that seedy, mad, old school New York vibe. Austin Butler reminds me of a young Brad Pitt, the blokes just a bonafide movie star. Fantastic cast all round\n9. A lot of people really seem to think Guy Ritchie invented a genre.\n10. Can anyone confirm how big of a role action bronson has in the movie?\n  - He has multiple short scenes throughout, not just a random cameo but actual character who is also part of a plot point\n11. seeing all the early reviews, seems like I\u2019m much higher on it than most. I thought it was one of the best movies I\u2019ve seen this year (watched like 50 so far)\n\n## 14. The Death of Stalin (from r/movies)\n\n**Score:** 1301\n**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1n44xea/the_death_of_stalin/\n**Body:** Last night I discovered that The Death of Stalin is on Tubi, so I finally had the chance to watch a movie that I'd heard good things about. My thoughts: what a bizarre, unique, gem of a movie. Hard to even categorize. Yes it's a comedy, but only because it accurately reflects the absurdity of Stalinist politics. It manages to be over the top while staying basically true to history. The chaos, performative grief, scheming, and backstabbing following Stalin's death is played perfectly by a cast of heavy-hitters who make it all the more farcical by playing it straight. Overall, I really liked this movie, but it's probably not for everyone. Thoughts?\n\n### Top 8 comments and their replies (up to depth 25)\n\n1. The amount of times I go back and watch this movie... its so perfect. All of the gang coming to see Stalin the next morning when he is dying... Everything Jason Issacs says or does as [Zhukov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Zhukov),, Everything Rupert Friend does as Vasily, the funeral movements. Michael Palin saying \"Stalin would have loved this\" multiple times during some horrific thing.   Its so funny and only gets better.\n  - My favorite thing about this movie is every time I watch it I find an interesting one off line or action that a character does and I simply *must* look it up to see if it really happened. An *astonishing* amount of this movie is based on real things that happened and every time I think something might be an exaggeration, im proven dead wrong. Most recently, I was curious about the [plane crash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950_Sverdlovsk_plane_crash) that Vasily was trying to cover up that killed the entire Soviet ice hockey team and that just... fucking happened lmao.\n    - In some cases they toned things down (like the number of medals Zhukov wore) because the reality seemed _too_ silly.\n      - Jason Isaacs apparently wore a pillow under the uniform to make his chest appear broader and make room for the medals and they still couldn\u2019t fit them all. Zhukov was both ridiculously broad and had an absurd amount of medals. \n\nZhukov also really loved Pepsi, being introduced to it during the war. But the leader of the red army couldn\u2019t be seen drinking a western drink, so Pepsi formulated a version that was clear just for him and packaged it in vodka bottles. The leader of the red army being an extreme alcoholic was apparently a better look.\n    - Or that they killed all the decent doctors in The Doctors Plot. So they could only find a decrepid one for Stalin\n      - \"You're not even a person! *You're* mostly hair!\"\n  - Vasily breaking into Stalin's autopsy and firing a gun into the air. Everyone standing around awkwardly as someone wrestles the gun out of his hand. \"Now, let that be a lesson to you all.\"\n2. I watched it once because someone said it was good. \n\nI watched it the next 20 times because Jason Isaacs.\n  - The slow mo shot when he takes off his coat and the chyron appears is #absolutecinema\n3. Passed uuuuuuuuuuu....nanimously\n4. Also came here to note Isaac\u2019s appearance as Zhukov put this movie into 6th gear. Buschemi as Khrushchev made no sense, and all the sense. One of the better firms I\u2019ve seen in the last 5 years\n  - The absurdity of Buscemi playing Kruschev was brilliant.\n    - I 100% agree. The way he would also be the clearest sanest voice in the entire film was very well done.\n  - Jason Isaacs and Andrea Riseborough did an interview together, and it made me appreciate his Zhukov all the more\n\n\nAndrea Riseborough talked about all the research she did into Svetlana Stalin, and how she tried her best to copy Svetlana's characterisms and personality\n\n\nWhen discussing Zhukov, Jason Isaacs said something like, \"I just decided to play a massive swiggering dick\"\n\nPlus, the Yorkshire accent is just the fuckin cherry on top lol\n5. One of my favorite movies. Hilarious and full of deep meaning at the same time. Amazing performances from the whole cast.\n\nI'm in, I'm in. That fucker thinks he can take on the Red Army? I fucked Germany, I think I can take a flesh lump in a fucking waistcoat.\n\nKhrushchev: I really need your help.\n\nZhukov: To do what? There's bodies fucking piling up in the street, it's a bit late, isn't it?\n\nKhrushchev: What if we blame this on someone...\n\nZhukov: Wait...\n\nKhrushchev: Who's out of control?\n\n Zhukov: Nicky, be very careful what you say next. Who?\n\n Khrushchev: Beria.\n\nZhukov: I'm going to have to report this conversation. Threatening to do harm or obstruct any member of the Presidium in the process of...\n\n\\[grins\\]\n\nZhukov: Look at your fucking face!\n\n\\[bursts out laughing\\]\n6. \" Overall, I really liked this movie, but it's probably not for everyone. \"\n\nI loved it, I can imagine the gallows humour not being to everyone's taste, but it wasn't trying to appeal to everyone.\n\nIsaacs as Zhukov stole the show, and that's saying something in a comedy up against Palin, Whitehouse, Tambor and Buscemi.\n  - I loved the fact that they had to *reduce* the number of medals on movie-Zhukov\u2019s tunic - because the real number would have looked absurdly unrealistic!\n7. The concept is crazy: adaptation of a French bande dessin\u00e9e retelling the death of Stalin... by the British creator of The Thick of It.   \nAnd yet, it's perfect. Insane casting, incredibly funny. \n\nIt's so quotable it's unreal: \"The army's back, did you miss us?\u201d\n  - \"I'm gonna go represent the entire red army at the buffet\"\n    - \u201cYou should have seen your face!\u201d\n\n## 15.

For me it's when a vehicle loses control, putting them in a frightening situation where they have to dodge obstacles and try to get the vehicle to a halt. Off the top of my head, there's only two comedy movies I can think of that feature that, but they're both funny as hell.\n\nScene 1: *The Little Rascals Save The Day.* In this movie, the brakes fail on their homemade taxi cab and they go rolling down the road screaming.\n\nScene 2: *Mr Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.* I'm not entirely sure if this is the movie but I think it is. In this one, Mr Lampoon goes sledding on a trash can lid and something makes it slippery, making him go way further than expected.\n\nSo that's my take. What oddly specific type of comedy scene do you find really funny? Add an example of it if you can.\n\n### Top 13 comments and their replies (up to depth 25)\n\n1. I could barely breathe I was laughing so hard, when Jim Carrey is trying to get out of the rhino in Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls.\n2. The greatest set piece in comedic movie history: \n\nLlyod and Harry driving through the Rockies &gt; Harry standing around the barrel fire complaining that his hands are freezing &gt; Lloyd telling him he can use his extra set of gloves &gt; Harry attacking Llyod for keeping the gloves to himself throughout their drive &gt; Llyod screaming at Harry because of his hands are cold.\n  - Omg, that sounds fucking hilarious. What movie is that? I gotta watch that ASAP!\n    - Dumb and Dumber.\n  - A couple months ago I was at a \"brand meeting\" for the Marriot property I work for and at one point they put up a slide show with a collage of pictures with brands that you know by just looking at them. Tesla, Gucci, Starbucks, etc, you get the picture (pun intended). One person asks what the picture of the luggage was and presenter says \"Samsonite.\" To which I boisterously reply without skipping a beat, \"SAMSONITE!!? I WAS WAY OFF!!!\"... no one laughed, no one got it, I stood up and left the meeting. As I walked out, a guy from another group across the hall, alledgedly coming from the bathroom, was laughing his ass off, looked at me and said \"Samsonite?!!?\" We now drink at the same bar on Thursdays.\n3. The Naked Gun (1988) has a great chase scene like that\n4. Another one for you is rat race\n\n\n&gt;!You should have bought a squirrel!!&lt;\n  - It\u2019s a race! I hope I win. \n\nI\u2019m getting goosepimples\n5. The bribery scene in \"The Other Guys\" is one of my all-time favorite gags.\n6. It took me years to notice but I call it **grinding to a halt**.   This is when the story is moving along and all of a sudden nothing is happening.  It's usually a dialog exchange that serves almost no point.\n\nMONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL -- When King Arthur wants to ask an 'old woman' in the field who lives in nearby castles, and the man he is talking to explains he's a man, not a woman, and 37, not old.  It's the type of thing that would be cut from any other movie but is hilarious here.\n\nAUSTIN POWERS -- like Python, Myers does this all the time.  In the first feature he's having trouble turning a cart around in a too narrow passageway.   In the sequel, Dr. Evil stops a meeting to accuse Scotty of not liking chocolate, which absolutely positively doesn't contribute to the plot in any way.\n  - Similarly, when Zoot/Dingo/Carol Cleveland stops the scene, turns to the camera and asks if we think this scene should have been cut and other characters from other parts of the movie join in. \n\nAt least ours was committed and wasn\u2019t just a string of pussy jokes.\n\nThere\u2019s a moment in the television show, during the Dead Parrot Sketch, when Mr. Praline arrives at \u2018Similar Pet Shops Inc.\u2019 and then holds the birdcage up to the camera with an exasperated look on his face - it\u2019s the same set as the first pet shop and the cage is still where he left it. And behind the counter, the shopkeeper is scrambling to put on a fake moustache.\n7. ivebeenthrushit, if you haven't yet watched Bob Zemeckis' rollicking comedy **Used Cars**, *do.*\n8. The scene in Anchorman 2, when the guys are driving in the RV has me laughing out loud!\n  - Hey Ron, why do you have this bag of bowling balls and this terrarium full of scorpions???\n9. Channing Tatum's accent in Deadpool 3 (and pretty much the whole movie for that matter)\n  - The fight in the mini van where they keep kicking the stereo and then, for a split second, it plays \"The Greatest Show\" and I ERUPTED in my seat for significantly longer than I should have. That movie was like 98% Easter eggs.\n10. Robert Downey Jr in Due Date. Looks right at the Dog and says ,\" You fat little piece of shit,\" then spits in the dog's face. Shocking ,but my god did I laugh.\n11. There is such a scene in National Lampoons Vacation where Clark falls asleep at the wheel.\n12. All of the performances by clearly non-actors in The Greasy Strangler. The hot dog salesman had me crying laughing. Mindboggling line delivery.\n\n---\n\n"}

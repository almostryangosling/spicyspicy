There are so many creative ways to make a thriller about a devastating earthquake but they had to make an unrealistically massive Tsunami (would never happen) and have California go underwater(again, would never happen). \n\nThis movie probably spread so much misinformation about earthquakes just for a shitty B tier action movie.\n\n### Top 8 comments and their replies (up to depth 25)\n\n1. You've never seen Moonfall then.\n  - \"the moon is helping us!\" as gravity selectively works on some stuff but not others\n  - I got hurt and had to sit on a couch for 3 months. That movie was my favorite when it came on TV. It\u2019s almost like it was a genius student getting nearly everything wrong on purpose.\n2. Lucy   \n\"She's now able to use 100% of her brain!\"\n  - And it unlocked sorcery, apparently\n    - I can probably overlook all the inaccurate biology, but then she produces a USB memory out of her own body, and I was like GTFO\n      - She just converted the microplastics that were in her body.\n        - USB is stored in the balls\n  - \u201cWe only use 10% of our brains\u201d just like we only use 33% of a stop light.

The professor was a chill young meteorologist who knew most of us were in it for the easy A. At the end of the semester, we watched The Day After Tomorrow while he did commentary on everything wrong with the science. I\u2019ve loved that movie ever since.\n  - It may be a tad underrated, but still love the scene where the characters \u2018run away from the cold\u2019 in Day After Tomorrow- Jake Gyllenhaal surviving by creating a massive fuckoff fire\n4. The X-Files movie hinges on bees picking up alien DNA from cornfields as they pollinate them.\n\nExcept bees don\u2019t pollinate corn at all.

The Happening, where people attempt to run away from the wind.\n7. 2012\n\n\"The neutrinos are mutating!\"\n  - Dara O\u2019Brien ended one of his standup specials talking about that line.

Looking for films that deserved way more attention but got overshadowed by blockbusters. I'm thinking quality dramas or thrillers that critics loved but audiences missed. What's a movie you always recommend but nobody's heard of?\n\n### Top 18 comments and their replies (up to depth 25)\n\n1. A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM (1990) with Michael Caine, Peter Riegert, Elizabeth McGovern, and Will Patton.\n\nJust a really fun, dark little comedy with Caine having an absolute blast as a man who discovers a great way to get that promotion he deserved.\n2. The Zero Effect\n\nBill Pullman stars as a modern day Sherlock Holmes called Daryl Zero, the smoothest of operators when working, an absolute ass when not. Ben Stiller is Arlo, his PA and whipping boy. It has a smart script, a great cast and an excellent story involving murder, blackmail, and a radiant water heater. Endlessly quotable, too. Directed by Jake 'son of Larwence' Kasdan, and it's just an excellent movie.\n3. The Dish. Excellent Australian film about the moon landing.\n  - We all watched that at work. But we work on radio telescopes.\n4. [Arlington Road.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137363/?ref_=ext_shr) Stars Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, and Joan Cusak. Story about US domestic terrorists. Wicked twist and it stands the test of time.\n5. Noises Off!\n6. Strictly Ballroom\n7. The Frighteners.\n  - I love The Frighteners. I wish the CGI tech was better at the time it was made. It was made during a transitional tech period when the CGI was just bad in a way that makes the look of the movie age pretty poorly in my opinion. But everything else about that movie is so fantastic. Script, direction, and cast are all top notch. I\u2019d love to see this movie with remastered effects. I don\u2019t need a remake because those performances, especially Michael J Fox, can never be duplicated or improved on.\n8. Strange Days\n9. Breakdown, the Kurt Russel movie\n10. Sneakers, featuring Robert Redford and a great ensemble cast. The kind of movie that you just have on whenever it comes on TV.\n11. 'Frailty' directed by Bill Paxton, an excellent film.\n  - My buddy and I snuck into this movie when it was in theaters and so went in completely blind to what the movie was and about. One of the best movie experiences I\u2019ve ever had.\n12. \"The Legend of 1900\" with Tim Roth and Clarence Williams111 from 1998.  I am a Piano music fan.\n13. Ravenous. To this day I am still unsure if it\u2019s supposed to be serious or if it\u2019s the darkest comedy ever made. Very entertaining either way.\n14. **Once Were Warriors** (1994, dir. Lee Tamahori). It's about a M\u0101ori family living in New Zealand and their everyday struggles with poverty, gangs, domestic violence, alcoholism and sexual violence. It can be a hard watch at times but the acting, especially from Lena Owen &amp; Temuera Morrison, is phenomenal.\n15. Until the End of the World\n16. 3 O\u2019clock High\n17. Go (1999) A poorer man\u2019s Pulp Fiction that I would argue is even more entertaining.  Massive cast that includes Timothy Olyphant, Katie Holmes, William Fichtner, Taye Diggs, Jay Mohr and some very early Melissa McCarthy.  \n\nThe movie didn\u2019t make much in theaters, but was well-received by critics and has attracted a cult following since its release some 25 years ago.\n\n## 4.

We'll be back tomorrow Thursday 8/28 at 5 PM ET to answer any questions.\n2. I hope this doesn't come across as rude, but since you mentioned mixed reactions and said you stand by your work, I thought I'd throw it out there.\n\nI haven't seen your movie, but I read a review of it that says: \"What they've done wrong is try to give four characters equal 'drama space', which I suppose looks good on the actors' showreels, but in terms of engaging audiences it does the opposite. Who is the protagonist, and who are their friends and enemies? Basic story question isn't addressed.\"\n\nI think this is an easy trap for new filmmakers to fall into, and from the trailer, I can see how that might be the case for Do Not Open. Do you think this is a fair criticism of your movie? Why or why not?\n\nSecond question is, do you have any plans to make more movies? If so, what would you say are the biggest things you've learned now that you have finished your first movie?\n3. I apologize, I have not seen your movie but I appreciate that you\u2019re willing to acknowledge any \u201cmixed reactions,\u201d do you think your film will be re-evaluated in the future, like as things maybe become even more relevant from your plot?\n4. Can you list 3 things you learned to do, or not to do, on your next film?\n  - 1. Don't wear too many hats, find a way to get the right support so you can focus on the story  \n2. Spend more time at the very beginning building relationships with festivals, distributors and audiences before filming frame 1. Know where you want the project to go and network along the way to build brand ambassadors.  \n3. Really find the right creative partners for the long-haul.\n5. Is this the 1st movie made by you guys ? What was it like making a movie and how did you get your movie released? Any advice you would have for other people who would like to make movies ?\n6. Which filmmakers do you draw the most inspiration from?\n  - Lynch, Fincher, Nolan, Scorsese are great and there are a ton of new-ish directors and projects that have been inspiring: Peele, Kwan &amp; Scheinert, and Bong Joon Ho for example.\n7. Hi Brian and Noelle, thanks for joining us!\n\nIf you could only bring 3 movies with you on a deserted island to watch for the rest of your life, what would they be? Bonus question: Best and worst pizza topping?\n  - Hi, I would bring The Lion King because it\u2019s a classic I\u2019ve loved since I was a kid, Forrest Gump because it\u2019s such a great story, and Just Go With It because it always makes me laugh.  \nWhat would you bring?\n8. Noelle, what made you choose this film as your first role? Was it written for you or you joined later on? \n\nAnd are you looking to do more acting? If so, will you stay in the thriller/horror genre or are you looking for different types of roles?\n  - I was brought into the project after the script was already written, so it wasn\u2019t written specifically for me. But as soon as I read it, I felt a strong connection to the character and the story. I wanted something that would push me out of my comfort zone, and this film definitely did that.\n\nAbsolutely, I\u2019d love to keep acting.\u00a0I\u2019m definitely open to different genres. I want to keep exploring and challenging myself with roles whatever the genre.\n9. Hey all it's Brian! I and No\u00eblle are here and going to answer some questions so feel free to hit us with whatcha got. Thanks so much to r/movies for having us, I'm a long-time listener and first-time caller.\n\nHere we go!\n10. Hey guys,\n\nSuper interesting and enjoyable movie, what a rollercoaster of emotions!\n\nNoelle are you planning on continuing your acting career? If so, what kind of roles would you be looking for?\n\nAlso, if you could choose any movie / series - old or upcoming to be casted for, what would it be?\n\nAnd what's your all time favourite dish?\n11. What was the inspiration behind the film?\n12. What is the next step for the movie?\u00a0\n13. Thanks so much to everyone here at r/movies. It was a pleasure to pop in and answer some questions. If you have a chance check out Do Not Open, I hope you enjoy the ride!\n14. Where do you get your ideas from?\n  - This is always the tricky question as there really isn't an answer that will either capture the truth or not sound like an outright lie. But, I can answer where the idea for this project came from.\n\nI had written two other scripts before this one with the intention of finally making a movie. Since I was 14 I wanted to make a feature and I started the long process of figuring out how to get it done. The first two scripts I wrote I really loved but they were too expensive and expansive so I had to give myself some rules to make the script accessible. I would use my apartment because I had it and could use it for free. I would use cameras I owned. It would be a small cast. Essentially, I made a bottle episode of a movie.\n\nSo, with those rules in mind I started to play with concepts and ideas. Using different cameras and different feels of the cameras drove me to start thinking about all the cameras on our phones, computers, houses and such. Then over about a year the ideas started building, the family came together, the themes of each character started developing and then I started finding a narrative that began a journey of its own.\n15.

What really hooked me was how the story set up a character to look like the one in danger, only for things to completely turn around. That twist of power, where the victim isn\u2019t what they seem, made the whole movie so much more intense and exciting to watch. It gave the usual horror-thriller formula a fresh and brutal edge that stuck with me even after it ended.\n\nNow I\u2019m looking for more films with that same kind of hidden danger vibe\u2014where someone you think is weak, trapped, or in trouble turns out to be the real threat. Any recommendations for movies that deliver that kind of shocking reversal?\n\n### Top 17 comments and their replies (up to depth 25)\n\n1. Unfortunately, listing the films are probably a spoiler for anyone who hasn\u2019t seen them\u2026\nBut the first one I saw with that kind of twist was &gt;! Triangle (2009) !&lt;\n2. Don\u2019t Breathe\n  - Loved this movie. Dude was a menace. The second installment wasn't that great imo\n3. High Tension (Haute Tension) - 2003\n  - Sure, the twist was bullshit and made no sense, but the rest of the movie before it was fucking *fire.*\n4. &gt;!\u00a0Strange Darling 2024 !&lt;\n  - this was a fucking rollercoaster, my jaw dropped.\n\nfantastic movie (if you haven\u2019t seen it, go in blind)\n5. One of the segments in *Trick \u2018r Treat* (2007) certainly has this.\n6. Hard Candy\n7. You're Next (2011) and The Hunt (2020) are two good examples of that.\n  - The Hunt and Ready or Not will forever be my go to double feature in this niche. Don't know which one i love more.\n8. Better watch out\n9. Becky and Wrath of Becky, probably falls into this trope even though it's pretty obvious from the beginning. I enjoyed both of those.\n10. Abigail\n11. It\u2019s not a horror movie but I highly recommend A Perfect Getaway\n12. You\u2019re Next.\n13. Tucker and Dale vs Evil\n14. Pet(2016)\n15. Case 39.  I had it playing in the background this morning and it does fit your description.\n\nI do love \"No One Lives\".  I've always found Luke Evans kind of dangerous in most of his roles and this one really leans hard into that vibe!\n16. Strange darling\n\n## 11.

I\u2019m definitely more of a Thriller genre viewer and don\u2019t mind gore as long as it\u2019s not over-the-top. Looking for movies that are kind of more atmospheric or eye candy.

I\u2019m not big on monster / ghosts so Donnie Darko is the perfect example I can think of, it\u2019s more psychological to me than pure horror. AHS is one of my favorite tv shows \nand also has the perfect mix of campy horror that I can stomach. So if anyone has recommendations based on my examples, Id really appreciate it.\n\n\n\n\n### Top 14 comments and their replies (up to depth 25)\n\n1. Check out The Mothman Prophecies.\n2.

Just very well-made and effective at telling its story. Very creepy in parts.\n\n\n*Bring Her Back*, by the same directors, is scarier for most viewers by a good margain. Also a great, creepy film. Sally Hawkins is a dangerously good actor.\n5. Now im wracking my brain on what to reccomend to you..i love movies/shows like this ..ooooohhh!!!\nThe cell!!!!\n6.

It was on Showtime, and no it has nothing to do with the movie trilogy.\n10. Before I Wake\n\nThe Night House\n\nLate Night With The Devil\n11. Sleep 2021 (German)\n12. The Invasion (2007) I suspect you will like given that list.  Great list btw.  Its PG but man it scares the hell out of everyone I show it to.\n\nFor TV shows try the first season of Wayward Pines!  X-Files vibes but full contained horror story.  Go in blind.\n13. How have you not seen Super Dark Times(2017) ... Definitely full of Donnie Darko/Craft vibes... Its really one of my top favorites\n14.

Yorgos Lanthimos' 'Bugonia' Review Thread (from r/movies)\n\n**Score:** 863\n**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1n2hw54/yorgos_lanthimos_bugonia_review_thread/\n**Body:** [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bugonia): 100% (22 reviews) with 7.70 in average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/bugonia/): 79/100 (11 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; Bugonia is by no means Lanthimos\u2019 best work, but it looks spectacular thanks to the sheer richness, the stinging clarity and the eye-searing colors of Ryan\u2019s VistaVision images. Besides, what\u2019s not to love about extinction-level anxiety accompanied by the aching tenderness of Marlene Dietrich singing Pete Seeger\u2019s anti-war folk song, \u201cWhere Have All the Flowers Gone?\u201d\n\n-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/bugonia-review-emma-stone-jesse-plemons-yorgos-lanthimos-1236355544/)\n\n&gt; The timely urgency of \u201cBugonia\u201d could be identified from outer space unless you\u2019ve been living under a celestial object these days, as rogue vigilantes taking down corporate bigwigs have, in a post-2020 world, turned into the folk heroes dominating headlines and activating internet warriors. That\u2019s not to say \u201cBugonia\u201d carries an empowering message: If anything, it\u2019s distrusting in humanity\u2019s ability to rise above our own failures, arguing that while it\u2019s not too late to turn things around, we probably won\u2019t anyway.\n\n-[Ryan Lattanzio, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/bugonia-review-emma-stone-yorgos-lanthimos-1235147826/): B\n\n&gt; Yorgos Lanthimos, the director of \u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d and \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d has become a squirmy master of this brand of violent-outsider filmmaking; let\u2019s call it enlightened misanthropy. He\u2019s working in the tradition of directors like Stanley Kubrick and the Oliver Stone of \u201cNatural Born Killers,\u201d but Lanthimos operates with his own dark playfulness. His new movie, \u201cBugonia,\u201d is a heady and gripping experience, in no small part because it takes the form of a duel \u2014 tactical, philosophical, brutal \u2014 between two characters who might almost be locked in a contest entitled \u201cWho\u2019s the More Outrageously Spectacular Anti-Social Offender?\u201d\n\n-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/bugonia-review-emma-stone-jesse-plemons-yorgos-lanthimos-1236499397/)\n\n&gt; On one level, which punchline the film eventually plumps for doesn\u2019t matter: it\u2019s in the twisty agonies of the telling that the buzz of Bugonia lies. But it has to end somewhere, and perhaps some viewers will find the payoff maddening \u2013 though others (like your critic) will just bark at the sheer virtuoso mischief on show. Either way, what a joke.\n\n-[Robbie Collin, The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2025/08/28/bugonia-venice-review/): 5/5\n\n&gt; Bugonia is a very well made film, and while it is not true to say it is less than the sum of its parts, it is less than that final and very powerful part. Like Ari Aster\u2019s recent film Eddington, it also shows how difficult it is to make internet conspiracy obsession interesting. For me, Bugonia doesn\u2019t have the ingenuity and elegance of Lanthimos\u2019s previous film Kinds of Kindness, nor the emotional generosity and audacity of his steampunk fantasia Poor Things. It\u2019s a spiny, prickly, hothouse flower.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/28/bugonia-review-emma-stone-might-be-an-alien-in-yorgos-lanthimoss-macabre-conspiracy-theory-comedy): 3/5\n\n&gt; It\u2019s \u201cMisery\u201d meets \u201cMars Attacks\u201d meets all kinds of other stuff, with the excesses being quite entertaining, if not as satisfying as, say, \u201cPoor Things\u201d or \u201cThe Lobster\u201d or \u201cDogtooth\u201d or \u201cThe Favourite.\u201d Coming only a year after the sampler pack that was \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d this feels in a way like Lanthimos on automatic and in overdrive, churning out fun transgressions one after another because he and his leading lady have so much fun doing them. Then again, too much Lanthimos is still kind of a blast.\n\n-[Steve Pond, TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/bugonia-review-emma-stone-jesse-plemons-yorgos-lanthimos/)\n\n&gt; The power of Lanthimos\u2019s work has always come from his ability to provide surreal but dead-on metaphors that take on lives of their own: a futuristic resort where one must debase oneself to find a mate, in The Lobster; or a family where the parents have trained their kids to accept absurdities as reality, in Dogtooth. With Bugonia, it feels like he\u2019s entered our world at last, at least for a while. Which also makes it maybe the saddest film he\u2019s ever made.\n\n-[Bilge Ebiri, Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/bugonia-review-yorgos-lanthimos-enters-the-real-world.html)\n\n&gt; \u201cHumans can\u2019t help themselves,\u201d Michelle pointedly observes in the film. Lanthimos offers little evidence to refute her case \u2026 but ample evidence to love and care for their well-being even still.\n\n-[Marshall Shaffer](https://theplaylist.net/bugonia-review-yorgos-lanthimos-paranoid-thriller-starring-emma-stone-movie-built-for-our-times-venice-20250828/): A\u2013\n\n&gt; Lanthimos allows us the grace of that ending only after he\u2019s put us through the wringer, maybe even boring us a little along the way. The world isn\u2019t pretty, and Lanthimos is sounding the alarm. If only he would tell us something we don\u2019t already know.\n\n-[Stephanie Zacharek, Time](https://time.com/7313036/bugonia-movie-review/)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nTwo conspiracy-obsessed young men kidnap the high-powered CEO of a major company, convinced that she is an alien intent on destroying planet Earth.\n\n**DIRECTOR** \n\nYorgos Lanthimos\n\n**WRITER**\n\nWill Tracy (based on the film *Save the Green Planet!* by Jang Joon-hwan)\n\n**MUSIC**\n\nJerskin Fendrix\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nRobbie Ryan\n\n**EDITOR**\n\nYorgos Mavropsaridis\n\n**RELEASE DATE** \n\n- August 28, 2025 (Venice Film Festival)\n\n- October 24, 2025 (worldwide)\n\n**RUNTIME**\n\n117 minutes\n\n**STARRING**\n\n- Jesse Plemons as Teddy\n\n- Emma Stone as Michelle Fuller\n\n- Aidan Delbis as Don\n\n- Stavros Halkias as Casey\n\n- Alicia Silverstone as Sandy\n\n### Top 8 comments and their replies (up to depth 25)\n\n1. Is this guy the most efficient worker ever? Feels like he puts out a movie a year recently\n  - Kinds of Kindness felt like a very small production, plus it was kind of split into three. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the turnaround time on that was only 3-4 months.\n    - It looks like it was about 9 weeks of production, then a year and a half until it released.\u00a0\n      - Felt like something that was shelved and then rushed to release after the buzz from poor things.\n        - Well, Poor Things itself was filmed back in 2021.\n          - What happened was that Poor Things was a fairly VFX-heavy movie, so it had a long post-production period, and a lot of it was just waiting on VFX. So in that time since Yorgos didn\u2019t have that much to do himself, he decided to quickly shoot Kinds of Kindness since it was a small movie and he felt the script was ready. Then they went back to finish and release Poor Things before finishing and releasing Kinds of Kindness, which is why it also took a while to come out.\n  - He and Luca Guadagnino have been on a roll lately, defying all mildly-racist stereotypes about Greek and Italian work ethic\n2. It's a Yorgos movie. You're either going to love it or loathe it.\n  - Sometimes both at the same time.\n    - I don't feel like I'm getting my money's worth if I walk out of a Yorgos movie feeling clean and normal.\n  - My pet peeve is when ppl say \"you either love it or hate it, there is no in-between!\" about a piece of media because invariably it's said about something I myself was left cold by.\n\nSame here. I've been following Lanthimos since Dogtooth and my opinions are all over the spectrum. I adored Dogtooth and Alps, enjoyed Poor Things and Kinds, merely liked Favorite, hated Kinetta etc.\n    - Yorgos is one of my favorite filmmakers, and yet he has films I really don\u2019t care for. But I\u2019ll go support him every time. Strange phenomenon!\n\nLOVED: Dogtooth, The Lobster, Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite\n\nEnjoyed: Poor Things\n\nDidn\u2019t Like: Kinetta, Alps, Kinds of Kindness \n\nI basically think his mid-career run of 4 films is one of the best runs of movies of all time (or at least my favorite)\n3.

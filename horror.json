{"content": "## 1. Leigh Whannel responds to claims that 'Sinners' isn't a horror movie on Bluesky. (from r/horror)\n\n**Score:** 2595\n**URL:** https://bsky.app/profile/conanthecontrarian.bsky.social/post/3lxdqu3pvq22o\n**Body:** Reposting with more clarity and context for those that were confused. The original post on Bluesky read:\n\n&gt;The reason Sinners is so good is that it's not a horror movie. It is a film about the Black experience, and the immigrant experience in America. It tells the story of marginalized peoples and uses vampires as allegory to tell that story. It is SO much more than a \"vampire movie.\"\n\nLeigh's response:\n\n&gt;Doesn't matter how many great horror movies get made, doesn't matter how many times they've saved the theatrical movie business since Covid... the genre still can't get any respect. The \"it's not a horror movie\" crowd is always there. This includes filmmakers who can't admit they made a horror\nmovie.\n\n### Top 9 comments and their replies (up to depth 25)\n\n1. This isn't even some new concept. Horror has been used as allegory for literally centuries now. You can trace all of it back to ancient mythologies, cultural traditions, and religious doctrines.\n  - Frankly, it's hard for horror not to be allegorical. \n\nIt's based in fear and dread and so much of that draws from how we interact with society.\n\nLike, I bet they think Dracula is just a monster who drinks blood, and isn't about scary foreigners, the fall of tradition, and the growing prominence of female sexuality. Or Frankestein being a scary monster, rather than musings on what it means to be human and what narrow definitions of humanity fail to capture.\n  - What's a film like Candyman if not an allegory? What's almost any horror if not an allegory for *something*? Horror is almost never just about what it's about. \n\nUsing vampires to as the inroad to tell a story about the black experience is about as horror as it gets\n2. Somehow you can make a film about a vampire hivemind tearing people to shreds and you'll **still** have folks going \"yeah, but that's not a horror movie\"\n\nLike I get the message the original post is trying to convey, but the movie can absolutely be both a portrayal of black experience during Jim Crow **AND** a banger action horror. No one ever said you have to choose one\n  - Ari Aster said something in an interview that really stuck with me about hereditary. I\u2019m going to paraphrase here, but the general idea was this.\n\nHorror is a genre, just like any other genre, and a genre is a lens that we choose to tell our stories. If a director has something they want to say, a story they want to convey, you can tell similar stories using multiple types of lenses. What separates good horror from mediocre horror is when the story is \u201chey, I\u2019m a horror movie\u201d that\u2019s usually not going to feel very compelling, vs, \u201cthe horror movie is a lens for this story I am telling\u201d\n\nNow, to apply that to this topic, I think a lot of people get confused for some reason when a director tells a REALLY good story using the horror lens. Suddenly they say \u201cwell that\u2019s not horror, it\u2019s this type of story\u201d but the fact is that it\u2019s both. \n\nSinners is so obviously using a horror lens, to tell a compelling story. That makes it a horror movie.\n    - What would you say are examples of \"Hey, I'm a horror movie\" movies? \n\nFor some reason, (though I do like them) the Friday the 13th movies were the first that came to my mind lol\n  - Are you telling me that art can be multiple things at once?\n\n![gif](giphy|gBpY4p7bbhsiI)\n\n/s\n  - Portraying the Black experience in Jim Crow America IS a horror movie, no matter the genre.\n3. He's so right. I get so sick of the genre getting downplayed or erased because people like something in it, but are too stuck up to admit they like horror. That always seems to be what it boils down to. Or people just trying to sound more \"in the know\" than they are, and they come off as elitist and pretensious. Just let the movie be what it is: a horror story about the realities of being black AND an immigrant in this country.\n  - Thank you! I feel like a lot of people still look down on horror. This is like when things were \u201celevated horror\u201c all of a sudden. Nope you snobs don\u2019t get to reclassify something just because you can\u2019t admit that you like horror.\n4. This is how we got the term \u201celevated horror\u201d\n\nFuck anyone actually using it\n5. Why can't these snobs just admit they liked a horror movie?\n  - Because just like animation, the snobs dont consider it \"art\". Which is ironic, because a lot of big name actors, like Johnny Depp, George Clooney, Hilary Swank, Leonardo DiCaprio, and more, have either started in horror or played a significant role in a horror movie.\n    - Where would Jennifer Aniston be without Leprechaun?\n6. Using vampires or other monsters as an allegory for a human experience is exactly what horror movies do. That\u2019s what makes horror great, it\u2019s a vehicle for telling a story about the human condition. Dude basically said it\u2019s not a horror movie and then described it as exactly what a horror movie is.\n7. \u201cHereditary isn\u2019t a horror movie you guys, its just about generational trauma and the fear of following your parents abusive footsteps and how horrifying that is\u201d\n8. And Get Out is a dark comedy, Weapons is a mystery, 28 Years Later is a sci-fi allegory, Silence of the Lambs is a police procedural, etc., etc., etc.  You're correct.\n  - The Thing is about Christmas with the boys and the cool dog they found outside\n  - I have a friend who tried to tell me 28 days later is a drama not horror\u2026..and yes the original one not the new one\n    - It's weird but I think some people only deem something a horror movie if it scares them. If they don't get scared then it must not be a horror. It's stupid and they're incorrect but I genuinely think that's the reason for these insane takes\n\n## 2.

Like he probably could have asked for anything.. but apparently a few decent acting parts was enough to convince him\n\nJohn Cassavetes was so incredibly well cast in the role. His every very smirk and smile has that little flicker of malice and self-loathing In it..  so oily.  You could always tell that he knew more about what was happening to Rosemary than he let on. What gets me so much about him is how incredibly relatable his moral failings are as he reflects what so many people are willing to do  to stay in the good graces of power, and what they're willing to sacrifice for a miniscule advantage\n\nWe see these people parade across the stage all day and there's nothing we can do to stop them.\n\n### Top 16 comments and their replies (up to depth 25)\n\n1.

The old man in Barbarian\n  - Frank got too easy of a death. It would've been ideal if he got torn apart by the Mother\n    - She was scared of him, she backed away from his room\n  - Pretty upsetting that he\u2019s loosely based on a real person. Josef Fritzel, if you want to google it, but it\u2019s pretty freaking horrifying.\n\nThat movie\u2019s great though, I just rewatched it for like the 3rd time\n4. The grandma from Hereditary has got to be up there. Offers her entire bloodline up for sacrifice to a demon in the hopes of riches.\n5.

I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve hated a character more than Sally Hawkins in Bring Her Back\n9. The fuckin' aunt from The Girl Next Door. I have watched hundreds of horror movies in my life. I have never hated a character more in all of fiction, and knowing she was based on a real person just made it worse. Watched that movie once -- got it for like 2 bucks from an HMV on a whim while I was buying a bunch of other movies and CDs -- and could never bring myself to watch it again.\n  - That's definitely one you don't want to accidentally watch when you were expecting a lighthearted comedy starring Elisha Cuthbert.\n10. Vidal in Pan's Labyrinth.\n\nI know he's everything you're supposed to hate about fascism and tyranny embodied in a single person but del Toro did an amazing job of making me almost palpably despise a fictional character.\n11. The organization or cult or whatever they are in Martyrs. They're all terrible\n12. That fucking bitch Bev in Midnight Mass.\n13. The soldiers in 28 Days Later were planning on raping an underage girl.\n14. Chris in Carrie. Carrie\u2019s mom is also a vile monster but also clearly has severe mental issues and trauma which likely warped her view on people and her daughter. Chris was just a sociopath who found joy in tormenting Carrie for no reason other than for her own joy and power.\n15. bev's dad in IT\n\n## 3.

We didn't see her fawning over Opera.\n  - https://preview.redd.it/pqq7a2ltkfmf1.png?width=1272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b29e71e698130f604f27b20b76085fb4aae913c4\n\nThis goes far beyond having high expectations for him. They're literally mocking him right in front of him.\n    - Far or not, that's the explanation. Katakuri was supposed to be perfect, both invincible and good looking. Flampe is a brat, but they are a family of psychopaths, we can't expect her to know better. Also, she is like 15 years old, teens can be this cruel and irrational.\n      - You read people on reddit and you see that, indeed, teens and not so teens can be cruel and irrational.\n        - Yeah, many people can be very cruel when they preconceived idea of a situation turns out to not be true.\n      - Flampe is such a funny Name for me as German. Its Sounds Like the word \"Schlampe\" with means Bitch.\n\nIt really fit her bratty demeanor\n    - Yeah...after all of those years of expectation to be immensely ruined when they finally saw what Katakuri actually looks like...\n\nCome on, similar things to this also happen to irl public figures. Surely you've seen some case of e-celebs getting canceled or having their reputation ruined overnight despite being beloved for years before, right?\n      - Dream literally looked like a regular 20 year old dude and since peoples expectations were so high for some reason it became drama when he did a face reveal\n      - CorpseHusband\n    - Katakuri being mocked for his way of eating/mouth and Pudding being seen as a monster for her 3rd eye in One Piece's setting, even by random kids who knows they're children of Big Mom, and who looked like the ugly noble kids from Goa Kingdom, has to be the worst part of WCI (which I consider solid overall).\n\n\nLike, OP's world is a sandbox of different fantasy races, eccentrics and literal freakshows, with BM's children being the biggest show of that in a single arc, except for Kaido's 100 Bums army for few exceptions. How tf Pudding is somehow considered more monstrous looking than any other of her siblings, to the point BM herself treat her like that ? Makes no sense\n  - https://preview.redd.it/o01in5j7ehmf1.jpeg?width=1232&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ebf26b45c0c433ca2f88967f0100e104da4eb8f\n\nTheir own mother already set the low bar for expectation.\n    - Big Mom is such a hypocrite is funny, like, she calls Pudding a freak. Ma'am, have you looked in the mirror lately?\n4. That\u2019s how it looks if you take away the context of the situation. The only reason she reacted that way is because he was seen as normal and perfect even. Everyone looked up to him. Pudding and others are fair game though.\n5. The same thing also applies to Pudding, Loki, etc.\n  - I\u2019d argue that these two are really unusual even by One Piece standards\n\nLike we normalize all kinds of wacky looks as being the same but no one else has a 3rd eye or demonic eyes\n6. Ugh, don\u2019t make me take up for Oda\u2026 but prejudice is always arbitrarily applied. That\u2019s before we even get to the context of how the younger siblings saw him prior to the reveal.\n7. I fucking hated that grape built bitch. Worst character for me. My hatred for her has no limits.\n8. I never understood how big mom\u2019s children like Katakuri, Pudding , Brulee get bullied as if they aren\u2019t pratically Royalty of Totto land.\n\n## 11.

I am a horror movie junkie. I have seen 946 horror and horror-adjacent movies. Out of these, 628 have been \"bad\" (I have an IMDB list of these, I'll DM you if you're interested, but I don't wanna break the self-promo rules). This includes zero-budget student films, Syfy monster schlock, and movies that I just really did not like.\n\nI love all of this trash. It's great, and I would love recommendations for the worst horror movies that you all have seen. Can be horror adjacent too, it just has to have some sort of \"horrifying\" element.\n\nThanks.\n\nEdit: Alright, I looked through a lot of these suggestions, and I plugged 140 of them into a Wheel of Names. Wish me luck.\n\n### Top 18 comments and their replies (up to depth 25)\n\n1. Things (1989)\n  - Yeah, that looks... interesting. Thanks.\n2. Uninvited- A mutant cat inside of a normal looking cat terrorizes young people on a ship. George Kennedy and Clu Gulager\u00a0\n3. The Suckling! A woman\u2019s aborted fetus transforms into a mutant monster that tries to kill her and her friends. I feel like the Street Trash movies would be a good pick as well, and The Incredible Melting Man.\n4. Zombeavers\n  - That is art.\n5. GingerDead man\n6. Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead\n7. Birdemic!!\n8. Uwe Boll's House of the Dead (2003).  I believe this may be the worst horror movie I ever saw in my life.\n9. Bloody Muscle Body Builder in Hell is a must-see.\n10. House of the Witch\n\n\n\n\nThe Bye Bye Man\n\n\n\n\nHouse of the Dead (2003)\n\n\n\n\n\nThey/Them (2022)\n11. If you can find a copy, Devil Story. It\u2019s a poorly dubbed French movie. A Nazi zombie/monster chases people and a guy spends much of the movie trying to shoot a horse with a shotgun while yelling at it. I bought a copy from Vinegar Syndrome and it was worth it.\n\nOr\n\nSpookies. An unfinished movie that was haphazardly finished by a completely different director. It\u2019s got cool creatures, terrible acting, and a nonsense plot.\n12. Ax Em is a contender for one of the crappiest slashers ever made. Wikipedia says it had a $400,000 budget, and like The Room, there's no way most of it ended up on screen. You can tell the director only did this one movie, it has every amateur mistake, including botching the audio recording, there's no way they had a boom mic.\n\nFrom MST3K, Monster A-Go-Go and The Beast Of Yucca Flats were the worst horror movies on the show, worse than Manos The Hands Of Fate. Monster was an unfinished Bill Rebane movie that was bought by Hershel Gordon Lewis when he needed a b-feature, so he did some cheap reshoots without the original cast and it just abruptly ends since they didn't have anyone who looked like the monster. The Beast Of Yucca Flats was by Coleman Francis who had 3 movies shown in season 6, all terrible. His first movie had no sound recording, so the audio was added in post, with random narration that has nothing to do with anything in the movie, like out of nowhere, \"flag on the moon. How did it get there?\"\n13. Basket case (1982) horror/comedy. They also made two other films after this haven\u2019t seen them but the first one was just ridiculous\n14. Dead Heat.\n  - This is the best buddy cop zombie movie ever made please delete this.\n15. Popeye the slayer man\n16. *Verotika*\n17. I mean, are you talking the kind of bad that makes people not want to finish? Or the kind of bad that\u2019s just gloriously trashy?\n\n## 13. Celebrities Who are Actual Nerds (from r/TopCharacterTropes)\n\n**Score:** 14074\n**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5ma99\n**Body:** A lot of celebrities are fairly vapid, even those related to nerdy stuff. And sometimes they're just normal people collecting a paycheck. I don't expect a voice actor to understand every facet of a video game or cartoon they do work for.\n\nHowever, sometimes, a true nerd slips through the cracks. Here are some of my favorites.\n\nPeter Cushing: Respected Shakespearean actor famed for playing Sherlock Holmes and Grand Moff Tarkin (and being in several Hammer Horror Films), Cushing is also a fairly famous war games player, back before even Games Workshop developed Warhammer. \n\nHenry Cavill: (Insert witcher interview here) Cavill is built like a brick house, and yet has some fairly nerdy passions. He builds computers and loves LOTR and Warhammer 40k. It's kinda funny seeing him wasted on stuff like Mission Impossible when his dream gig is a 40k adaptation.\n\nRobin Williams: A gamer back when gaming was still in its infancy, Williams loved Nintendo so much, he named his daughter after Princess Zelda. He was also a bit of an animation nerd, hiding a reference to Evangelion in his movie 1 Hour Photo.\n\nChristopher Lee: More of a classical nerd than a modern nerd, Lee is a lover of history and swords, even having his own. He's also very literary, and when asked to voice the villain Last Unicorn, brought a book with all the passages he wanted adapted highlighted. And one of his last big things was being in a metal music video with some local garage band.\n\nWho are some of your favorite nerds who achieved acclaim?\n\nAnd of course, RIP to all three of the ones listed who are no longer with us. Mad props to all of them.\n\n### Top 11 comments and their replies (up to depth 25)\n\n1.

He said he'd even just be a stormtrooper in the background, anything really, and George had a think. Months later, when Episode 1 was filming he got a call to head over to London where the shoot was happening, and he only found out he was a Jedi when he got into costuming. Someone had to explain to him he'd be sitting right next to Yoda, and then he had to pick a lightsaber from a tray of options.\n\nHe was so incredibly giddy while telling this story, it's clear he was really excited about the whole thing. And he got BMF inscribed on the on button of the saber, which is just great.\n5.

Fun (actually Depressing, but \"Fun\") Fact about Robin Williams: he desperately wanted to play Professor Oak in a live-action Pokemon movie, a passion the Pokemon devs apparently shared. Long after his death, Detective Pikachu wanted to use the character, but The Pokemon Company vetoed it, because they believed Robin was the only person that role belonged to.\n  - rest in peace, williams\n  - Also less known, but Robin Williams also played warhammer 40k.

It completely floored me it all holds up so well after 40+ years. Basic pick, I know, but it really earned its reputation for me.\n\nI\u2019m on a mission to dive deeper into the genre, so I\u2019d love to hear your take: what\u2019s your magnum opus of horror? It can be the best, your favorite, or both totally subjective!\n\nYou can add it [here](https://stackl.ist/3VtasSE), just paste links and ill watch them all during my free time!\n\n### Top 14 comments and their replies (up to depth 25)\n\n1. Jaws for me but I\u2019m old. The Thing for practical effects and Alien for franchise longevity/quality.\n  - Just a reminder that Jaws is out in the theaters for it's 50th anniversary now.\n2. The Thing is a solid pick.\n\nI\u2019d go for Alien though.\n  - Either and I\u2019d add American Werewolf in London.\n    - American Werewolf in London was my best horror cinema experience. The special effects were awesome. It had just the right amount of humour. And there were a couple of really good jump scares. It has also aged really well. It\u2019s still good to watch.\n  - The thing genuinely creeps me out every time I watch it\n3. Original Halloween. Lost weeks of sleep in 1978 from that one!\n4. Texas Chainsaw Massacre\n  - Agree here. It's so gritty and had held up very well. I used to think Nightmare on Elm St was the GOAT, but Texas Chainsaw Massacre has aged better imo.\n5. Night of the Living Dead still holds up, and is one of the most influential films of all time.\n6. I think my favourite horror movie is Ring (1998). It's almost entirely creepy vibes. Almost nothing happens on screen. It's all creepy electronic noises and slow-burning tension. It uses weirdness rather than gore or jump scares to ramp up the tension. It's one of the best movies for being unsettling but also enjoyable and watchable.\n7. There's just something deeply, genuinely unsettling about the original 'Nosferatu' even a century+ later. Sure it's old and doesn't have what you'd call jump scares, but even now it has this pervasive sense of \"wrong-ness\", like something that was unearthed from where it shouldn't have been. So that'll always have my vote.\n8. The Shining is a strong contender\n  - The Shining is one of very few examples of a horror movie made by a truly great filmmaker. It is disturbing on many levels and is a complex film that can be interpreted and analyzed many different ways. In other words, it is fantastic art.\n9. It Follows. I enjoyed it more than any other horror film. Everything about it just felt like a film-length nightmare. The scares, the anachronisms, the music, the whole atmosphere of the movie was so well designed. It made me scared for weeks. It can even bear rewatches, even if you know what will happen, I still get scared.\n10. Probably it's the Exorcist, it's scary and shocking without relying too heavily on gore and unexpected loud noises. It's kind of genre defining and has to be a GOAT contender. \n\nBut honestly, The Omen is my horror happy place so I'm changing my mind and voting for that, the film is genius.\n  - I've only seen this movie once like 25 years ago and it still haunts me.\n11. Alien. It\u2019s untouchable.\n12. **Event Horizon** is one of my favorites and hasn't been mentioned.\n13. ORIGINAL version-  DAWN of the Dead\n\n## 15.

I would struggle not to dig it up myself for fun. I\u2019d probably sell the house on purpose just so I could see the completion of the joke.\n  - I was hoping you'd suggest covering it in thick perspex so you can look down and admire your little scene\n    - There\u2019s a library I went to in Italy somewhere which had Perspex floors so you could see the ruins and archeological digs underneath. I guess they found a bunch of stuff during a reno and thought that was a cool idea also.\n4. that is just a way to get under the car - no criminal activity\n5. Eel pit for sure\n  - where to obtain eels\n    - I know a guy. You need lube too or got your own?\n6. I would use it to work on my car or as a cellar.\n7. Had one of these growing up. Dad used it to store his home brew.\n8. Trap door and ladder.
